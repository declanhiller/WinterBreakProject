summary of game...

main character - hedgehog

idk the story yet

porcupine mother or some shit and the quill from the dead mother is being used as a spear

post apocalyptic world... basically overgrown futuristic city world with defunct robot technologies that kind of works and act as bosses now
Bosses are very puzzled based

Player Stuff
 - Regular Jump
 - Regular Run
 - Very simple stab attack for now
 - Grappling Hook that can pull you to the location you grappled immediately
 - Climbing... basically like sticking to the wall and going up and down it... will also be a rappel animation to go over the edge and when a player jumps to an edge and misses slightly

 Player Animations
 - jump
 - fall
 - run
 - wind up grapple
 - throw grapple
 - trigger grapple
 - attack (spear stab)
 - climb
 - rapple over edge
 - and whatever tweening animations may be necessary depending on animation technique

Player Stuff I'm not too sure about
- Using spear as a platform to spin to greater heights
- Swinging using grappling hook
- Super jump boop. basically a yin yang relationship with the grapple
- Adjustable attack sequences
- Comboes with grapple and regular attack
- Special upgrades to spear that allows you to use it in different and unique ways to move around... a playstyle basically

Other Stuff
    Need a camera pathing tool to handle zooming out and zooming in to show scale of bosses while making levels actually playable
    Might also need to create a procedurally generated pathing tool to handle more procedurally generated fights...
    or set it so that each piece has predisposed pathing and then picking what piece goes next

    Need to really make it so that there aren't seperate scenes when going from "level" to "level"
